# LLM and Code Analysis Practice Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (`2. Open `code_analysis_genai.ipynb`) that demonstrates various techniques for working with Large Language Models (LLMs) and analyzing code repositories.

## Overview

The notebook covers the following key areas:

1. Setting up a Python environment with necessary libraries
2. Cloning and analyzing a GitHub repository
3. Text splitting and embedding generation
4. Working with LLMs, specifically CodeLlama
5. Creating a conversational retrieval chain for querying code information

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Git

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd [PROJECT_DIRECTORY]
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   conda activate /venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install openai tiktoken chromadb langchain langchain-community GitPython gpt4all llama-cpp-python==0.2.77
   ```

## Usage

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open `code_analysis_genai.ipynb` in the Jupyter interface.

3. Run the cells in order, following the instructions and comments within the notebook.

## Key Components

- **Repository Analysis**: The notebook clones a sample repository (DEEP-AUTHENTICATOR) and analyzes its Python files.
- **Text Processing**: Demonstrates text splitting techniques for code analysis.
- **Embedding Generation**: Uses GPT4All embeddings for text representation.
- **Vector Store**: Utilizes Chroma for efficient similarity search.
- **LLM Integration**: Incorporates CodeLlama for advanced language understanding and generation.
- **Conversational Retrieval**: Implements a conversational chain to query information about the analyzed code.

## Model Download

The notebook includes steps to download the CodeLlama model. Ensure you have sufficient disk space and a stable internet connection for this step.

## Notes

- Some cells may require significant computational resources, especially when working with large language models.
- Ensure you have the necessary GPU support configured if you intend to use GPU acceleration.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with `llama-cpp-python`, you may need to install it with specific compile flags:

```
CMAKE_ARGS="-DLLAMA_CUBLAS=on" FORCE_CMAKE=1 pip install llama-cpp-python==0.2.77
```
